This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

Note: The {} allows for the code to run

```{r basic plot}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
# Area of pizza = pi * r^2
diameter = 12 # this is in inches
area = pi * (diameter/2)^2
area
```

```{r}
iris
```


```bash
git config --global user.email "lm798@cam.ac.uk"
  git config --global user.name "LidiyaMykhaylechko"
```

We can assign object with three different methods:

```{r}
diameter = 12
diameter <- 12
12 -> diameter
```

Can write text in the following ways:

```{r}
"this is text"
'this is also text'
"this is someone's text"
'this is someone\'s text'
```

Can turn this text, which are all as single values, to be part of a vector/column, with c function (combine)

```{r}
c("this is text",'this is also text',"this is someone's text",'this is someone\'s text')
```

```{r}
bloodtypes <- factor(c("A+", "B-", "O-", "A+", "O-"))
sort(bloodtypes)
```



## Exercises of "Data Types - 8.7"

Exercise 1:

```{r}
as.integer(TRUE)
# as.numeric(TRUE) is also possible but more vague
```
 
Exercise 2:
```{r}
Sys.time()
class(Sys.time())
```
# This data is date
The 'class()' function returns metadata and string encoding is important because not getting it right can screw up data...
Exercise 3:

```{r}
Sys.timezone()
class(Sys.timezone)
```
# This data is text

Exercise 4:

```{r}
'"Do you think this is a game?", he said. "No, I think Jenga\'s a game", Archer responded.'
```
